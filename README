"Strand" is an open-source implementation of the identically named
parallel Prolog dialect as described in the book "Strand: New
Concepts for Parallel Programming" by Ian Foster and Stephen Taylor.
Strand represents a very elegant and concise notation for expressing
concurrent and distributed algorithms using only a small number of
fundamental language constructs and a very simple execution model.


This implementation of Strand is written in Forth and runs on Linux
x86-64/ARM, Mac OS X x86-64 and OpenBSD amd64 systems, has no
dependencies and is entirely self-contained. Operating system 
facilities are invoked directly via system calls, no C runtime
library is required. The Forth system is provided with source
code and is able to recompile itself into an ELF or Mach-O binary.


"Strand" is a trademark of Artificial Intelligence Ltd., which
once offered a commercial implementation.
