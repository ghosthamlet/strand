Building Forth
==============

In case you want to modify the Forth implementation that runs the
Strand VM, you will find all required sources in this directory.
Execute one of the "build-*-*" scripts to recompile everything from
sources for the current platform, using one of the bootstrap binaries
in the "boot" directory. The resulting executable "ff" can be used
to replace the "ff" binary from which "strandvm" is built.

Building from sources for x86_64 requires the "nasm"[1] assembler.
Building for ARM requires gcc(1).

Currently this Forth implementation only runs on the following
platforms:

    Linux x86_64
    Linux ARM (32 bit only)
    OpenBSD x86_64
    Darwin x86_64

Ports to other operation systems are possible, but may require
support for different executable file formats. Ports to other
architectures will require a reimplementation of the assembly
language kernel. See also the "Porting Guide" contained in the
file "HACKING", in the base directory of the distribution.
