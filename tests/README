  task.st           Task tests
  idle1.st          Idleness-detection

Tests using multiple nodes:

  bb                Producer/consumer test with bounded buffer
  bigdata           Tests transmission of large data sets

  pc                Producer/consumer
  sc                Short circuit test
  srim              Send/receive with incomplete messages
